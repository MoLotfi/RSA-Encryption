# RSA-Encryption

This program implements the famous RSA encryption algorithm. The program is full of illustrating comments that shows what each functions do. Some of the fucntions included are

- Encoding function: converts letters to numbers
- Fucntions that converts from ascii to hexadecimal and vice versa
- Fucntions that converts from decimal to hexadecimal and vice versa
- Random prime number generator function
- A function for doing Euclidean Extended Algorithm
- Function that generates the decryption key
- Function that generates the encyrption key
- Encryption Function: Encrypt the message 
- Decryption Function: Decrypt the encrypted messages

The next step for this project is to include the "super-int" library that I coded to make it capable of dealing with very large integers
